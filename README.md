# Java_Logger

Logging messages can help developers to debug. Logged messages will be forwarded to a variety of destinations like consoles, files, OS logs, etc.

In this example there are two main files:

[App.java](/codeExamples/WebdriverDeclaration.java)

[log4j2.xml](/codeExamples/WebdriverDeclaration.java)

1. App.java: simple method which divides two numbers.
2. log4j2.xml: contains parameters for logging messages.
